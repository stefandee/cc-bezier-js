When only a single <u>t</u> value is given, this function will split a curve at <u>t=...</u> into two new curves that together are equivalent to the original curve.

When two <u>t</u> values are supplied, the curve is split on <u>t1</u>, after which the resulting second subcurve is split on (a scaled) <u>t2</u>, yielding a new curve that is equivalent to the original curve over the interval <u>[t1,t2]</u>.
