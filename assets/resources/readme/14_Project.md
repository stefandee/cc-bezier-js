Finds the on-curve point closest to the specific off-curve point, using a two-pass projection test based on the curve's LUT. A distance comparison finds the closest match, after which a fine interval around that match is checked to see if a better projection can be found.

<u>Touch and hold to set the point for projection.</u>
