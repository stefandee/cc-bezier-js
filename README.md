## Welcome
cc.BezierJS aims at integrating [Bezier.js](https://github.com/Pomax/bezierjs) with Cocos Creator 2.0.x

## Changes
Two components (BezierDrawAPI and BezierInteractionAPI) have been introduced to handle the rendering and interactivity of the Bezier curves.

## Examples
Check out the [demo](http://www.pirongames.com/wp-content/uploads/projects/cc-bezier-js/index.html)!

Most of the demos are interactive, so try and drag around the control points :)

## Install
1. git clone https://github.com/stefandee/cc-bezier-js.git
2. npm install
3. npm update

## Known Issues
The "Arcs" sample is not rendering properly.

Not all tests have descriptions.
